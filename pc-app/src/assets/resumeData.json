    "description":"During my degree I have been described by my peers as a hardworking individual. This stems from the fact that I am currently: running a few app projects, juggling my course rep duties, and maintained a 74% in year 2. With Mathematics and Computer Science being my main interests, I have learnt how to think critically and analytically, to solve problems in a creative manner and how to get complex tasks done efficiently. I am willing to take any training necessary to learn new skills and better myself.",
